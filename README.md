# Intro
This project dedicated to help people learning CUDA program. It is different from 
NVIDIA official docs which might need you spend lots of time to read and understand.
Instead, the project connect with real scenarios and brief explanation to make you 
get knowledge as easy as possible. Some parts of the project have different versions, 
which help readers understand them gradually and know how to optimize a kernel/function at the same time.
To make project compile simple, each part is individual and has its own file. 

eg. 
```
cd matrix_multiply 
make
./matMul
```
